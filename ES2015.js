// 1. var is function scope while let is block scope. Var can also be redeclared while let and const both cannot be.

// 2. const is block scope like let, and cannot be redeclared or reassigned.

// 3. The difference between let and const is; let can be reassigned but not redeclared, while const cannot be reassigned or redeclared.

// 4. Hoisting refers to how variables are treated. Variables will be moved to the top of the scope they are declared in.
